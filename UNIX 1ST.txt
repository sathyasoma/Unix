OPERATINGG SYSTEM:
------------------
SOFTWARE==>COLLECTION OF SPECIALIZED PROGRAMES CALLED AS S/W

2 TYPES of softwrs

1)APPLICATION SOFTWARE-->	WHICH IS GOING TO REACH/MEAT ALL END USER REQUIREMENTS.(WORD,DATABASES,BROWSERS,PRESENATATIONS ...ETC)

2)SYSTEM SOFTWARE--->
	1)OPERATING SYSTEM(IS A SOFTWARE WHICH OPERATES ALL HARDWARE COMPONENETS OR INTERFACE BETWEEN USER AND COMPUTER HARDWARE)
	HIGH LEVEL LANGAUAGE TO LOW LEVEL LANGUAGE(USER TO MACHINE)LLL TO SYSTEM(OS TO HARDWARE AND HARDWARE TO OS)OS TO USER HIGHLEVEL LANG.
	
	2)SYSTEM UTILITES(THE MAIN FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE DOING IN THE OS DISK CLEANUP,DISK DEFRAMENTER,SPILTERS,SYSTEM RESTORE...ETC)

 
 
 FUNCTIONALITIES OF OS:
 -------------------------
 1)MEMORY MANAGEMENT(PRIMARY MEMORY(RAM),SECONDARY MEMORY(ROM))
 2)FILE MANAGEMENT(FILE NAME,TYPE OF FILE NUMBER OF CHARECTERS,SIZE,HOW MANY LINES...ETC)
 3)SECURITY(NOT RELATED TO HACKING SECURITY RELATED TO PROCESSING,MULTIPROCESSING WITH OUT DISTURBING OTHER PROCESS,JOB SHEDULING)
 4)DISK MANAGEMENT
 
 
 SERVICES OF OS:
 ------------------
 1)PROGRAM EXECUTION(PROGRAM EXECUTION(JAVA,.NET,PHP)--->INTERPRETATION).
 
 
 "DEVICE DRIVER"(FROM KEYBOARD TYPE SOMTHING IT WILL COMMUNICATE WITH OS THE CONVERTION WILL BE MADE BY KEYBOARD DEVICE DRIVER  EX MOUSE,KEYBOARD,PENDRIVE,USB).
 
 
2)I/O OPERATION(KEYBOARD,TOUCH PEN TOUCH PAD)'


TYPES OF OPERATING SYSTEM:
-------------------------
IN IT INDUSTRY THERE ARE NUMBER OF OS WE HAVE, BUT MAINLY DEVIDED INTO 3 TYPES

1)SINGLE USER SINGLE TASKING(SUST)-->(ONE OS ONE PERSON CAN ABLE TO OPERATE,TYPING SOMTHING IN WORD WE CANT PRINT SIMULTANIOUSLY),EX:DOS,AMIGAOS,WINDOWS95,98,MILLENNIUM,MAC OS(APPLE)
 
2)SINGLE USER MULTITASKING(THE USER CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC ON THE COMPUTER WHILE WRITING AN ARTICLE USING A WORD PROCESSOR SOFTWARE.

3)MULTI USER MULTI TASKING (LATEST GENERATION OS,MUMT)

THESE OS ALLOW SAME DATA AND APPLICATIONS TO BE ACCESSED  BY MULTIPLE USERS AT THE SAME TIME,THE USERS CAN ALSO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER EX:LINUS,UNIX AND WINDOWS7




WHAT IS UNIX:
-----------------
IT IS COMMAND USER INTERFACE OS,IT CAN ABLE TO WORK ANY TYPE OF COMPUTER(MINI,MICRO,SUPER,MAINFRAME...ETC)

HISTORY:-
-----------
IN YEAR 1969 AT AND T(BELL LABORITIES)LABS,STARTED BY A PROJECT(MULTICS(MULTI INFORAMTION COMPUTING SERVICES)-FIRST OFFICIAL OS IN IT INDUSTRY..IT MAXIMUM SUPPORTS 2 USERS) LEAD BY KEN THOMSEN,DENNIS RITCHI


AND IN 1971 TO OVERCOME THE DRAWBACKS OF MULTICS AGAIN REIMPLEMENTED,THE NEW PROJECT NAME IS UNICS(UNIPLUXED INFORMATION COMPUTING SYSTEMS DEVELOPED IN ASSMBLEY LANGAUAGE OR SYMBOLIC LANGAUAGE OR LOW LEVEL LANGUAGE )

IN 1972 DENNIS RITHCIE C LANGUAGE LAUNCHED 
 
 B LANGUAGE  KEN THOMSON

IN 1973 DENNIS RITHCIE,KEN THOMSON AND OTHERS REIMPLEMENTED THE UNICS BY RENAMING TO UNIX DEVELOPED IN C LANGAUAGE.




FEATURES OF UNIX:
==================
1)MULTI USER CAPABILITY(MULTIPLE USERS CAN ABLE ACCESS SYSTEM RESOURCES(RAM,MEMORY,APPLICATION PROGRAMES)AT THE SAME TIME.)

2)MULTI PROGRAMMING(MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS CAN ABLE TO RUN AT THE SAME TIME)

3)PORTABILITY(WE CAN RUN THE SOFTWARE IN ANY HARDWARE DEVICE).

4)SECURITY(FILE SECURITY,FILE HIDDEN,AUTHNTICATION)

5)MACHINE INDEPENDENT.

6)UNIX FILE SYSTEM IS USED TO STORE INFORAMTION IN THE FILES.

7)STRONG NETWORKING SUPPORT(WITH THE HELP OF SOCKET PROGRAMMING).

8)UNIX SHELL PROGRAMMING.


==>SHELL MEANS COLLECCTION OF UNIX COMMANDS.


PIPES AND FILTERS:
------------------
* PIPE MEANS ITS A KIND OF REDIRECTION.

* FILTER IS FILTERING  WHAT OUTPUT EXACTLY WE REQUIRED.

	TYPES OF FILTERS:
	------------------
	GREP,F-GREP,E-GREP...ETC
	
	
	
UNIX ARCHITECTURE:
------------------

 HARDWARE:-IT IS A PHYSICAL COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM. EX: MONITER

 KERNEL:-LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING,IT IS HEART OF THE OS,DEFINE:-KERNEL IS INTERFACE BETWEEN SHELL AND HARDWARE.IT ALWAYS PAERFORMS LOW LEVEL TASKS(EX:DEVICE MANAGEMENT,MEMORY MANAGEMENT,SYSTEM CALLS CONTROL...). 
 
 SHELL:-HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE(CAT,LS,CP,MV,GREP,EGREP,FGREP...COMMANDS)
 
 APPLICATION PROGRAMS:-WORD,POWERPOINT,BROWSERS,DATABASES...
 
 USER:-
 
 
 UNIX FILE SYSTEM:-
 -------------------
 
UNIX FILE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:

ROOT DIRECTORY-->	/

SYSTEM DIRECTORYS-->bin(binary),dev(device),boot,home,etc,usr....etc 


** UNIX IS CASE SENSITIVE.(THE ABOVE COMMANDS SHOULD BE IN LOWYER CASE).
