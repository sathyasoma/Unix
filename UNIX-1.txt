
what is unix:
------------
unix is an Operating System,which is created in 1960.

your father learned UNIX

you learning UNIX/linux

your kids will UNIX

60 yrs before OS

with several enhancements and improvements to base  version,several flavours introducecd by 
organization/companies.(RedHat Linux, UBUNTU, CENTOS).

Charectristics of UNIX:
------------------------
   1.it is free ware
   2.it is open source
      the source code how the commands are implemented  we can see.
	    we can customize  sourc code  based on our requirements
	
	durgasoft---> durgasoft flavours
	

It IS FOSS===> Freeware  and open source software.

  3. UNIX can be used by multiple users simulteniously, Hence it is multi user operating system.
  
  4, In UNIX , multiple tasks can be  executed simulteniously,  Hence it multi tasking operatig
system.	
 
   5. windows is GUI based
      
	    UNIX is CUI based (base version)
		there are multiple UNIX favours  which supports  both GUI, AND CUI.hence it is userfrindly.


  GUI and CUI which is more convient?
  
     CUI is more better than GUI
	     GUI we can small kind operations
		  (we can create one folder only one time,we cant creat multiple ate one time)
	
	     CUI we can create at single time multiple operations.
		 
           command: cui:  =>   mkdir dir{1..100}
         
        file.txt1, file.txt2....file.txt100
		
		To create a file: touch  (command)
		
		touch dir{1..100}/file{1..100}.txt1     ==>10000 files will created
		
      GUI--GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
	  CUI--CHARECTER USER INTERFACE
	  CLI--COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
	
  6. it is vry secured
       file permissions ==> permissions are very stronger
	   we can set permissions at user leve, gruop level, and other levls also.
	   

Flavours of Linux:
------------------
   linux os which is developed based on UNIX only

it is customized os, any one can customize unix3

Ubuntu
RedHat
centOs
fEDORA
Slackware
Open Solaries
Kali
Mint
Suse Linux Enterprise Server
Open Suse

distrowatch.com    100 of flavours are available.



  car driving==> bmw
                 Audi    5 min or 5km difficult


Components of UNIX:
===================

2 Components:
    1. Shell
	2. Kernel
	
1-=> user types a command on the terminal
        touch sathya.txt1

Shell:
======
   itis outer layer of OS
   shell Recievs the command
   Shell will check whether this command is valid or not?
   Shell will check whether this command is properly used or not?
   
   
* If everything is proper, then converts/interpreted this command into kernel understandable form
and handover to kernel.

kERNEL:
======
  It is core component of OS
Kernel simply executes that command and perform required activity .
  memory allocation,processor allocation every thing takes care by kernel 
Shell acts as interface between user and kernel.
Kernel acts as interface between shell and hardware.


very basic commands to enter into linux world:
=============================================
online terminal:
===========
   http://www.masswerk.at/jsuix
   
  * it is free terminal and written in java script
   *we can access this terminal by using any browser.
   
* 
  1.pwd==>print working directory
  2.ls==>list out all files and directories
  3.mkdir==>to create new directory
  4.cd==>change directory
  5.touch==>to create an empty file
  6. rmdir-->to remove directory
  7.rm=> to remove a file
  8.cal==> current month calender
  9.date==>to display current date and time.
  10. help--> to display list of commands
  11. hello-->to display brief systsem information
  12. clear-->to clear the screen
  13. exit-->to close current session. 
  
  
  



Directory Navigation commands:
==============================
cd..  ==> go to parent directory

In every directory there are 2 hidden files by default.

.  -> representing cureent working directory

..  -> parent directoty.

to change to user home directory:
================================
~   -> always poining to users home directory

cd ~

if we use cd command without any argment:

    cd    => simply moves users home directory
	
	
cd ~  =  cd    are same 


if we want move privious working directory: 
 cd -
 

cd . ==> to move to current working dir(useless)

cd .. ==> to move to parent working dir

cd ~  => to move to users home dir

cd     => to moveto users home

cd -  => to move to previous wrking dir


ls command:
----------

list out files and directories present in the given directory.
if we are not providing any directory the it will find in cwd.

ls--> list out all files and directories in cwd

ls /etc
ls dir1 

if multiple filess are then in which order these will be dispalyed?
   in alphabeticl order.
 
we required reverse order?
   ls -r
   
==>
man pages  = manual pages

man <command_name>

man ls

* ls -l  =>mean long listing


- rw- r-- r-- 1 durga  newgrp 16 apr


The first charecter represent type of the file.

- means normal file.

d means directory.


rw-  r--  r--

* first three represent user permissions(owner)

*next 3 prmissions sre (group permissions)

* last 3 permissions are (others permissions)


rwx order is important.

user permisions+group permisions+others permisions===> order imp.

 ex:
 ====
 
 project : durgasodt college automation system
 
 module-1:
  A,B,C,D are working
  
 module-2:
   E,f are working
   
 module -3:
   G,H are working
   
 module-4:
   X,Y are working
   

 Developer A create demo.txt file.
 
 for demo.txt:
 ------------
 
 user/owner -->A ( the person who created file)

 Group --> B,C,D (the persons are who are working in the same module )
 
 Others --> E,F,G,H,X,Y(THE PERSONS WHO ARE WORKING OTHER MODULES)
 
 
 1 ==> represent the number of links 

 durga--> user/owner
 
 newgrp ==> group name
 
 16--> size of the file in (bytes)
 



*touch .abcd.txt (hidden file starrts with dot(.))

  if you want see hidden files.
      ls -a   (it can show all the files)
	  
* i dont want show file in alphabetical order
    i want based on creation time top old at bottem

  ls -l -t  ==> new files top, old filed files bottom

      * i want old files first, recent files bottom
  
             ls -l -t -r
	 
* by default ls command will dispaly all directory fiels and directories
  but not sub directories.
  
    ls -R

colors:
=======

blue--> directories

whilte color--> files

green color:--> execute files 

(based on flovers colors will be changed)

   * to disable the color   :  ls -f
   * to specified files:     ls -F
   
Q: which command will make long listing of all the files in our system including
hidden files, sorted by modification time(oldest first)
 
 Ans: ls -l -a -t -r

 (we can use any order)
                        ls -latr
		                ls -lrta
						ls -lrat


** if listing is very huge then we can see only particular number?

top 10 lines
bottom 10 lines

ls -l /etc  | head -4  (only we get top 4 lines)

ls -l /etc | tail -7 (last 7 lines we get)

	
**page by page: more and less commands

    ls -l /etc | more 
	     tab key to go to next page.

    ls -l /etc | less
	   
	   
more vs less:
------------
which is powerfull? : 

   *less is more powerful than more
       by using less we cn view page by page in both directions means
	      next page or to previous page
		    d  --> next page
			b  --> previous page
			

   
    *more always display only in forward directions 
	   only next page but not previous page
	   
date:
------

To display date and time

* to display only date but not time: mm/dd/yy

 cmd :  date +%D
 
 * to disply only time
 
    cmd:  date +%T

->date  +%d  --> only day value
->date  +%m  --> only month value
->date  +%y  -->only value in yy format
->date  +%Y  --> only year value in yyyy format

 * our own format

     date +%d/%m/%Y 
 
 * hours,minut,seconds
  
    date +%H    --> 24 hrs scale
	date +%I    -->12 hrs scale 
	date +%M    -->minuts
	date +%S    -->seconds
	
Q.create an empty file where file name contains currnet system date?

  	touch --> to create a file 
	
	 date +%d_%m_%y 
	 
 execute command and substitute its result where ever it is required?
 
   
Ans:  touch sathya.txt_$(date +%d_%m_%y).log
	
	      touch sathya.txt_$(date +%d_%m_%y_%H_%M_%S).log
	
	
cal command:
============

cal 8 2020


working with directories:
========================

mkdir dir1 

mkdir dir2 dir3 dir4 


mkdir dir1/dir2/dir3 
        it will create only one directory : dir3 
		dir1 sholud be availble already 
		in that dir2 sholud be available already 


mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3 
           path wiilbe created within it 
	
Q** dir6 dir7 dir8 dir9 dir10 
      in every directory creat files a.txt b.txt c.txt d.txt 
	  

  touch dir{6..10}/{a..d}.txt 


**
     heroins -->dir 
	   sunny
	        jan 2020--dec 2020,jan 2021- dec 2021..22
	   katrina
           jan 2020--dec 2020,jan 2021- dec 2021..22
	   karena 
	        jan 2020--dec 2020,jan 2021- dec 2021..22
	   anushka
           jan 2020--dec 2020,jan 2021- dec 2021..22


jan 2020 
   schedule_1.txt
   schedule_1.txt
   schedule_1.txt
   
   ....
   schedule_31.txt


 touch heroins/{sunny,katrina,karena,anushka}/{jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec}_202{0,1,2}/schedule_{1..31}.txt
 
 
**
    mkdir x y x/x1 x/x2 x/x1/x11 x/x1/x12 y/y1 y/y2 y/y1/y11 y/y1/y12
	
	mkdir -p x/x1/x1{1,2} x/x2  y/y1/y1{1,2} y/y2 


To REMOVE DIRECTORIES:
---------------------

rmdir 
   it will work for only empty directories 
     if the directory is not empty then we will get error
	   -r or -R options are not applicatble for rmdir 

rm
  To delte voth files and directories
    even directory non-empty,no problem rm can work 
      if we want to use rm command for directories we shuld use -r option 

          ex:  rm -r dir1   or rm -R dir1 


working with files:
-----------------
1. by using touch 

2. by using cat command 

3.by using editors (gedit,vi,nano editors...)


1.By using touch command:
-========================
  we can create only empty files

---
what is software:
  collection of specialized programs called software.
  
  softwares are classified into two types
   1.application software
   2.System software
   
   
   application software:
     which is going to meet all end user requirements like word processors,browsers and db.
	 
   System software:
      1.OPERATING SYSTEMS
	  2.SYSTEM UTILITIES
	  
  SYSTEM UTILITIES:
     The main functions which are doing in os, ex: disc cleanup,
	 

OPERATING SYSTEMS:
-----------------

os is a software which operates all hardware components,
  it is an interface bwn human and computer.
